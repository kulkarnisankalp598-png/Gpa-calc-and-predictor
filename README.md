# GPA Calculator

## Description
A Python-based GPA calculator that computes a student’s cumulative GPA using letter grades and weighted credit hours. Users can enter multiple courses, and the program accurately calculates GPA based on standard grade-point conversions.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as dictionaries, functions, loops, and user input validation.

## Features
- Supports multiple courses
- Uses weighted credit hours for accurate GPA calculation
- Handles standard letter grades (A–F)
- Clean, user-friendly command-line interaction

## Technologies Used
- Python

## What I Learned
- Using dictionaries to store structured data
- Writing reusable functions
- Applying weighted averages in real-world calculations
- Handling user input and edge cases

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kulkarnisankalp598-png/Gpa-calc-and-predictor
